2-3question Experimental Report

Pros and cons of two methods

Introduce

I will give pros and cons of the two mentods by my experimantal analysis results.
This report will analyze by basic experimental method,threrfore, there may be something not professional.

Experimental images data

1.jpg is the source image
result.jpg got from the frist method
resul.jpg got from the second method


Experimental premise

the two methods aim at removing noise from images.
So the socure picture which we using a salt & pepper noise image as the experimental subject.

both the two methods be executed only once.


Criteria for judgment

I will jude the results by the following conditions:

1. the size of salt & pepper noise.
2. if the noise is still exist.
3. the clarity of image


Experimental results

the first method

1.pepper noise become bigger and wore than before
2.salt part almost disappeared
3.There is some image distortion, not serious

the seocnd mentod

1.pepper noise become smaller
2.salt part almost disappeared
3.Image distortion serious


Conclusion

the frist method 

pros: image distortion is not serious

cons: noise size is worse than before

  
the second method

pros: noise size become smaller 

cons: Image distortion serious


Insufficient

1.try more times for removing noise
2.Using other type noise for experiment


Further advice

Trying MSE or PSNR for image processing as the control group
